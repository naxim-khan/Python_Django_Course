Inside mypage folder we got a bunch of files 
but exactly what is it for?.
______________________________________________________________________
manage.py 
(It's a file where we wouldn't change anything we shouldn't touch this file
don't change logic of this file.

we'll later use this manage.py file and also know more about it later)
Because this file will give access to some builtin django commands.
which we can use in different django project.

______________________________________________________________________
sub folder (manage.py) inside view:

__init__.py :

    > it's empty and we don't need to make any change here. 

    > it's only meant to the folder where our mange.py and 
    all these folders or files are save.

    > It's store these files and folders as a python Module or 
    Package.

asgi.py & wsgi.py :

        > We actually don't need to touch these files also for the moment.
        > They'll become important later. Once we wanna deploy our project 
        into a real server.
        > To expose to our project to the word.
        > They'll help us to serving our files at end.

setting.py :
        > We're actually allowed here to make changes .
        > The setting.py file actually contains on global settings for our project
        > we'll fully understand setting.py from time to time.
        > At the begaining we don't need to make many changes to setting.py file.

urls.py : 
        > That as an important file when we start to add more and more
        files to our web application. here we have to register all those
        pages .

        > To make sure that they can be loaded for different urls.
        > we'll be going to a detail look in time to time.


And we'll also be adding our own custom files.

Above is the rough overview of why all these files matter.

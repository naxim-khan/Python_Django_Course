1. Migration Folder:

    > ignore it for now it'sll become important latter.

there are some new files inside our app which are below 

1. admin.py :
            > We'll use it for adminstation area latter.
            > for the moment it doesnot matter.

2. apps.py : 
            > contains :
                from django.apps import AppConfig

                class ChallengesConfig(AppConfig):
                    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
                    name = 'challenges'

                    > name = 'challenges' <-- we could change this name but 
                    it's actually matching the name of our app so we would leave as it is.
                    and this name will be needed later to identify this app.

3. models.py :
              > it'll become important once we start working the database 
              and we add data model's to our project.

4. test.py : 
            > it'll help us with automated testing and unit testing.


5. views.py : 
            > this file actually matter's 
            > we'll actually write some logics here.

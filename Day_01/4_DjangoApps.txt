We got our Django project here, they (mypage) project.

    > Inside this there is another subfolder mypage.
    > which contains some python files.
    > Django projects embrace a modular Structure.
    > Django project contains multiple modules that make up the project.
    > IN Django word they we didn't call them modules we call them apps.
    > And you store your actual application code in those apps.
    > To add different features to your entire project.You add multiple apps that hold those features.

Let's create our new app. Inside our Django project.

For this we are again going to use manage.py file.
> And there the startapp sub-command
> And then any name of our choice.
> (py manage.py startproject start app challenges)
